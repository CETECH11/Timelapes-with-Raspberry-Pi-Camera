Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom. The Raspberry Pi project originally leaned towards the promotion of teaching basic computer science in schools.The original model became more popular than anticipated, selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It is widely used in many areas, such as for weather monitoring,[19] because of its low cost, modularity, and open design. It is typically used by computer and electronic hobbyists, due to its adoption of the HDMI and USB standards.

The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B was released in June 2019  with a 1.5 GHz 64-bit quad core ARM Cortex-A72 processor, on-board 802.11ac Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5, full gigabit Ethernet (throughput not limited), two USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.0 ports, 1â€“8 GB of RAM, and dual-monitor support via a pair of micro HDMI (HDMI Type D) ports for up to 4K resolution. The version with 1 GB RAM has been abandoned and the prices of the 2 GB version have been reduced. The 8 GB version has a revised circuit board. The Pi 4 is also powered via a USB-C port, enabling additional power to be provided to downstream peripherals, when used with an appropriate PSU.

The Raspberry Pi Camera Board is a custom designed add-on module for Raspberry Pi hardware. It attaches to Raspberry Pi hardware through a custom CSI interface. The sensor has 5 megapixel native resolution in still capture mode. In video mode it supports capture resolutions up to 1080p at 30 frames per second. The camera module is light weight and small making it an ideal choice for mobile projects.

The camera board attaches to the Raspberry Pi via a ribbon cable. One end of the ribbon cable goes to the camera PCB and the other end attached to Raspberry Pi hardware itself. You need to get the ribbon cable connections the right way, or the camera will not work. On the camera PCB, the blue backing on the cable should be facing away from the PCB, and on the Raspberry Pi hardware it should be facing towards the Ethernet connection.

Time-lapse photography is a technique in which the frequency at which film frames are captured (the frame rate) is much lower than the frequency used to view the sequence. When played at normal speed, time appears to be moving faster and thus lapsing. For example, an image of a scene may be captured at 1 frame per second but then played back at 30 frames per second; the result is an apparent 30 times speed increase. Similarly, film can also be played at a much lower rate than at which it was captured, which slows down an otherwise fast action, as in slow motion or high-speed photography.
